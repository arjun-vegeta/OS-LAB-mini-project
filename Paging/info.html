            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. It divides both physical and logical memory into fixed-size blocks called page frames and pages, respectively. This approach offers several advantages, including efficient memory utilization and support for virtual memory systems.</p>

            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <h3>Page Frames</h3>
            <p>Page frames are fixed-size blocks in physical memory that correspond to the size of pages used by processes. They serve as the unit of allocation for processes.</p>
            <h3>Pages</h3>
            <p>Pages are fixed-size blocks in the logical address space of a process. They match the size of page frames and are mapped to page frames in physical memory.</p>
            <h3>Page Tables</h3>
            <p>Page tables are data structures used by the operating system to map logical addresses to physical addresses. They maintain the mapping between logical pages and physical page frames.</p>
            <h3>Logical and Physical Addresses</h3>
            <p>Logical addresses are addresses generated by the CPU and are used by processes. Physical addresses are addresses in physical memory where data is stored.</p>
            <h3>Address Translation</h3>
            <p>Address translation is the process of converting logical addresses to physical addresses using the information stored in the page table.</p>
